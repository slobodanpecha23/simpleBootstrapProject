        <h3>Rock and roll</h3>
        <p>Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll, rock 'n' roll, or rock 'n roll) is a genre of popular music that evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s. It originated from musical styles such as gospel, jump blues, jazz, boogie woogie, rhythm and blues, and country music. While rock and roll's formative elements can be heard in blues records from the 1920s, and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until 1954.</p>

        <h3>Jazz</h3>
        <p>Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with its roots in blues and ragtime. Since the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in traditional and popular music, linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, complex chords, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions.</p>

        <h3>Classical music</h3>
        <p>Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western culture, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more precise term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from before the 6th century AD to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1650 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period.</p>

      <h1 class="display-4">History of Music</h1>
      <p class="lead">The word, 'music' is derived from Greek μουσική (mousike; "art of the Muses"). In Greek mythology,
        the nine Muses were the goddesses who inspired literature, science, and the arts and who were the source of the
        knowledge embodied in the poetry, song-lyrics, and myths in the Greek culture. According to the Online
        Etymological Dictionary, the term "music" is derived from "mid-13c., musike, from Old French musique (12c.) and
        directly from Latin musica "the art of music," also including poetry (also [the] source of Spanish música,
        Italian musica, Old High German mosica, German Musik, Dutch muziek, Danish musik)." This is derived from the
        "...Greek mousike (techne) "(art) of the Muses," from fem. of mousikos "pertaining to the Muses," from Mousa
        "Muse" (see muse (n.)). Modern spelling [dates] from [the] 1630s. In classical Greece, [the term "music" refers
        to] any art in which the Muses presided, but especially music and lyric poetry."</p>
